# theOthello-project

## About
**theOthello-project** is a personal programming project to build a **console-based Othello (Reversi) game in C**.

The repository is created early to capture planning, structure, and progress as the project evolves.

At the moment, the project is in the **development phase**.

---

## What the Project Is
Othello is a two-player strategy board game played on an **8×8 grid**. Players take turns placing pieces on the board and capturing opponent pieces by surrounding them in straight lines (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).

This project aims to turn those rules into a clean, playable terminal application with clear logic and modular design.

---

## Planned Core Features
The first milestone is a complete, stable **Human vs Human** game:

- 8×8 board stored as a 2D array
- Turn-based gameplay via the terminal
- Full move validation in all 8 directions
- Automatic piece flipping
- Turn skipping when a player has no valid moves
- Game-over detection
- Score counting and winner display
- Clear separation of logic using functions

---

## Planned Extensions
Once the core game is solid, additional features may be added:

- Highlighting valid moves
- Piece counters during gameplay
- Last-move indicator
- Undo functionality
- Human vs AI mode
- Improved board rendering
- Cleaner menus and input handling

These features will be layered on top of the core logic without breaking it.

---

## Project Approach
- Build a stable core first
- Add features incrementally
- Refactor when needed instead of rushing
- Keep the code readable and maintainable
- Track progress through meaningful commits

---

## Current Status
**Early planning**

- Repository initialized
- Feature ideas defined
- Implementation not started yet

---

## Future Notes
This project may evolve beyond the original plan as ideas come up during development. The goal is to learn by building, breaking, and improving — not to rush to a finished result.
